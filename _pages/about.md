I am currently a Software Engineer at Google, working on Pixel’s Android apps. I am also National Taiwan University(NTU) class of 2025 B.S. in Computer Science.

I began coding in high school and have since gained experience with Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and React. Throughout my studies, I have explored various areas of computer science, including web mining, natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Beyond coursework, I participated in an entrepreneurship program, where my team built a fan-connecting app, and I have also joined volunteer programs to support children in rural areas.

In addition to my academic journey, I have completed software engineering and machine learning internships at Google and Appier. I also conducted research with the Information Retrieval Lab (Prof. Pu-Jen Cheng, NTU) and visited the DATA Lab (Prof. Xia “Ben” Hu, Rice University).

My current research interests lie in Information Retrieval, particularly in areas such as multi-agent systems, query style translation, and retrieval with images.
