# About

I am currently a Software Engineer at Google, working on Pixelâ€™s Android apps. I graduated in 2025 from National Taiwan University (NTU) with a B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering.

My coding journey started in high school and has since expanded to significant experiences in various areas of computer science, including web mining, natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Through coursework and projects, I have developed a strong technical background in Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and React. 

My professional experience includes software engineering and machine learning internships at Google and Appier. On the research side, I've explored my interests in Information Retrieval through my work with the Information Retrieval Lab at NTU and a visiting research program at the DATA Lab at Rice University. My specific research interests include multi-agent systems, query style translation, and image-based retrieval.

Beyond my technical work, I have been actively involved in extracurricular activities. I participated in a creativity and entrepreneurship program where my team developed a fan-connecting app, and I've also volunteered in rural areas. In my free time, I enjoy photography and traveling.
