## Welcome

I am **Szu-Ju Chen**, a B.S. student in Computer Science and Information Engineering at **National Taiwan University**. My academic and research focus lies in **Web Retrieval and Mining, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision**. I am passionate about applying machine learning to solve real-world problems and have experience in developing applications and research prototypes.
